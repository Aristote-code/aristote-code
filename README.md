## 💡 My Value Proposition

I bridge the gap between **design excellence** and **engineering reality**. Here's what I bring to the table:

✨ **Design Thinking at Scale**: Transform complex problems into intuitive, user-centered solutions  
🚀 **Rapid Prototyping**: From concept to working prototype in hours, not weeks  
⚙️ **Design Systems Expertise**: Build scalable, maintainable component libraries  
🤖 **AI Integration**: Leverage cutting-edge AI models (Claude, GPT, etc.) to enhance products  
🎨 **Full-Stack Design Engineering**: Fluent in both design tools (Figma) and code (React, Next.js, TypeScript)
