## 👨‍💼 About Me

I'm a **Design Engineer** and **Product Designer** passionate about creating exceptional digital experiences through the intersection of design strategy and technical implementation. With a proven track record of delivering 50+ projects, I specialize in:

**Rapid Prototyping & MVP Development** — Translating ideas into working products at lightning speed, often delivering fully functional systems in 24 hours or less without compromising quality.

**Design Systems & Component Architecture** — Building enterprise-grade design systems that scale across large organizations, improving team velocity and maintaining consistency across products.

**Full-Stack Design Engineering** — Bridging the gap between designers and developers by combining deep product thinking with technical execution, ensuring pixel-perfect implementations that match design intent.

**AI-Augmented Design** — Leveraging modern AI tools (Claude, GPT) to enhance design workflows, accelerate documentation, and create intelligent product experiences.

I thrive in environments where **speed meets quality**, where **ideas are validated quickly**, and where **user-centered design drives engineering decisions**. My approach combines design thinking methodologies with agile development practices to deliver products that users love and businesses can scale.

**Current Focus**: Building AI-powered design tools, architecting scalable design systems, and mentoring design-engineering teams.
